# What is **Threat Detection**?
> Threat detection is the practice of analyzing the entirety of a security ecosystem to identify any malicious activity that could compromise the network.
>
> Threat detection requires both a human element, as well as a technical element. The human element includes security analysts who analyze trends, patterns in data, behaviors, and reports, as well as those who can determine if anomalous data indicates a potential threat or a false alarm. - Rapid7[^0]

# Activities involved
* Rapidly deploying **detection controls**

* Proactively identifying **threats** in the environment

* Identify **new sources of data** and threat detection opportunities

* Creating **alerts**, **reports** and or **custom scripts** to aide in detection

* Developing a **continuous improvement workflow** for new detection controls, quality assurance and or maintenance of said controls

* Enriching threat detection data with **environmental specific** and or **threat intelligence** data
